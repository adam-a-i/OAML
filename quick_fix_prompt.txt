# Quick Fix Prompt for QAConv Features

**Change needed:**
- **Remove** the two separate blocks "QAConv Features (Query)" and "QAConv Features (Gallery)"
- **Replace** with a **single** purple rectangular block labeled "QAConv Features"
- Change the arrow from Feature Maps: instead of splitting into two arrows, use a **single arrow** from Feature Maps → "QAConv Features"
- **Keep** the arrow from "QAConv Features" → "QAConv Matcher"
- **Keep** everything else the same (Occlusion-Aware Matching arrow, etc.)

**Visual change:**
- Before: Feature Maps splits → QAConv Features (Query) + QAConv Features (Gallery) → QAConv Matcher
- After: Feature Maps → QAConv Features (single block) → QAConv Matcher

**Reason:** QAConv features should be shown as a combined batch, not split into Query/Gallery branches.
